This is an effort to extend Vim syntax files for Mozilla contributors and web developers:

* [cpp.vim](https://github.com/mozfr/mozilla.vim/blob/master/after/syntax/cpp.vim): C++ additions for Gecko components and macros
* [css.vim](https://github.com/mozfr/mozilla.vim/blob/master/after/syntax/css.vim): updated syntax file with CSS3 and HTML5 support
* [html.vim](https://github.com/mozfr/mozilla.vim/blob/master/after/syntax/html.vim): updated syntax file with HTML5 support
* javascript.vim: TBD, aiming to get some support for ES6 and the DOM API.

A Vim syntax file for JSON would be nice to have, too.

Contributions are welcome.
