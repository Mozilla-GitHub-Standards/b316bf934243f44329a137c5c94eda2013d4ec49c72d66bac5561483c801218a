This is an effort to bring better Vim syntax files for Mozilla contributors and web developers.

* html.vim: TBD
* [css.vim](https://github.com/fabi1cazenave/mozilla.vim/blob/master/syntax/css.vim): extended CSS syntax file with partial CSS3 and HTML5 support
* javascript.vim: TBD
* [cpp.vim](https://github.com/fabi1cazenave/mozilla.vim/blob/master/syntax/cpp.vim): extended C++ syntax file including Mozilla platform components and macros

Contributions are welcome.
